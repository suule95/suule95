- 👋 Hi, I’m @suule95
- 👀 I’m interested in collecting data from anywhere, cleaning them to fit into machine learning models to project future trends and increasing productivity by using the insights from the data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning Models, Statistics and data analyst skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require data collection, data pre-processing and making business decisions with someone who has a domain knowledge in their field.
